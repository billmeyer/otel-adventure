    "Tail sampling is where the decision to sample a trace takes place by considering all or most of the spans within the trace. Tail Sampling gives you the option to **sample your traces based on specific criteria derived from different parts of a trace**, which isnâ€™t an option with Head Sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of how you can use Tail Sampling include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Always sampling traces that contain an **error**\n",
    "* Sampling traces based on overall **latency**\n",
    "* Sampling traces based on the presence or value of specific attributes on one or more spans in a trace\n",
    "    - for example, sampling more traces originating from a newly deployed service\n",
    "* Applying different sampling rates to traces based on certain criteria, such as when traces only come from low-volume services versus traces with high-volume services.\n",
    "\n",
    "The downside to tail sampling today is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Can be difficult to implement. Depending on the kind of sampling techniques available to you, it is not always a \"set and forget\" kind of thing.\n",
    "    - As your systems change, so too will your sampling strategies. For a large and sophisticated distributed system, rules that implement sampling strategies can also be large and sophisticated.\n",
    "2. Can be difficult to operate. The component(s) that implement tail sampling must be stateful systems that can **accept and store a large amount of data**.\n",
    "    - Depending on traffic patterns, this can require a large number of compute nodes that all utilize resources differently.\n",
    "    - Furthermore, a tail sampler might need to \"fall back\" to less computationally intensive sampling techniques if it is unable to keep up with the volume of data it is receiving.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of these factors, it is **critical to monitor tail-sampling components** to ensure that they have the resources they need to make the correct sampling decisions."
