    "OTEL Configurations are organized into sections. The primary sections are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `receivers` - collect telemetry from one or more sources.\n",
    "* `processors` - take the data collected by receivers and modify or transform it before sending it to the exporters.\n",
    "* `exporters` - send data to one or more backends or destinations.\n",
    "* `connectors` - consumes data as an exporter at the end of one pipeline and emits data as a receiver at the beginning of another pipeline.\n",
    "* `extensions` - optional components that expand the capabilities of the Collector to accomplish tasks not directly involved with processing telemetry data. (e.g., health monitoring)\n",
    "* `services` - configure what components are enabled in the Collector based on the configuration found in the receivers, processors, exporters, and extensions sections. If a component is configured, but not defined within the service section, then itâ€™s not enabled.\n",
