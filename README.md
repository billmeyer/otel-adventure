# Conquer the Observability Frontier: An OTel Adventure

During this workshop, the adventurer will become self-sufficient in their quest to become familiar with the OpenTelemetry ecosystem. We'll accomplish the following:

* Stand up an OpenTelemetry Collector,
* Use Python and the OTel SDK to send metrics, traces and logs to the collector,
* Export the telemetry from the Collector and send to their own Datadog account to explorer and visualize,
* Setup and test Probabilistic and Tail-based Trace Sampling using OTel.

The toolset provided in this workshop can be reused any number of times to facilitate demos, customer conversations and debugging/troubleshooting OTel-related topics. This is the swiss army knife you've been looking for.

Your adventure awaits...
